automation and orchestration of the configuration and management of the network vital to succeed. In this context, several NRENs and institutions started to offer Campus Network Management as a Service (CNaaS) to their connected institutions a few years ago. During these years, the service has evolved from being a completely new experience that required an initial intense work on automation and definition of the services under the CNaaS umbrella to a more mature service that can change and include new services. The usage of continuous development and improvement as well as the integration of different software tools and vendors have been key to address the challenges coming from the diversity of equipment and &nbsp;the needs of the users. In this session, the latest news of the NRENs offering CNaaS services will be shared, together with lessons learnt and ideas for the future.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:null\">This Infoshare will be online.
